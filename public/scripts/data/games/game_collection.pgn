{To this day, the conditions surrounding this game aren't clear. According to
some sources, the regulations of the match included a two point clause;
Schlechter needed to win the match by a two point margin.  However, it is not
clear whether such a clause existed. Schlechter's aggressive play was
attributed to the fact that he was quite honorable and he played for the win
in order not to win a match by a "fluke", after Lasker's blunder from a better
position in game 5.  We may never find out the truth, but the players have
provided us with a fantastic game nevertheless.} 1. d4 {This is the first time

{To this day, the conditions surrounding this game aren't clear. According to
some sources, the regulations of the match included a two point clause;
Schlechter needed to win the match by a two point margin.  However, it is not
clear whether such a clause existed. Schlechter's aggressive play was
attributed to the fact that he was quite honorable and he played for the win
in order not to win a match by a "fluke", after Lasker's blunder from a better
position in game 5.  We may never find out the truth, but the players have
provided us with a fantastic game nevertheless.} 1. d4 {This is the first time

{[#] Smyslov's career - just like careers of so many other chess players of
that era - was inevitably affected by the World War II, during which all
International Chess Competitions ceased (and during which the whole world was
sent on turmoil, obviously). --- In fact, many of Smyslov's chess playing
peers and even childhood friends, who weren't necessarily as strong as him,
were called to army and ended up losing their lives on the battlefront.
Fortunately, Smyslov was not one of them as he got a job in the aviation (I
believe, but don't quote me on it) and spend the war years working in an
office, away from the front. --- On the other hand, even though there weren't
any International tournaments at a time, the Soviet Chess Federation was keen
on not letting their players to get completely rusty and organized quite a few
tournaments during the War Years. --- It was during one of those
war-tournaments - the Moscow Championship 1943 - when Smyslov managed to
defeat the great Mikhail Botvinnik for the very first time. --- Let's join the
came on move 21. Even though he employed a very dubious variation of the Ruy
Lopez, after an unforced error on Smyslov's part, Botvinnik took over the
initiative. At this critical juncture, he has to decide on the course of
action - and it is precisely here where Botvinnik went wrong. Can you do
better than the Partiarch and suggest a convincing course of action?} 21... Ne2

{[%csl Re6] In the previous two encounters, we have seen how Smyslov had the
ability to play very violent, tactical, Tal-like chess - especially in his
youth (but not only in his youth). However, as a player, he is much more
famous for his positional, logical and "simple" style with the help of which
he sometimes outplayed his opponents imperceptibly and quietly. --- A perfect
example of "vintage" Smyslov style is the following game, played against the
Ukrainian Master Iosif Rudakovsky in the 1945 USSR Championship. It is a very
famous game that I use to this day to illustrate the power of occupying the d5
square in the Najdorf structure and it is a classic example of the "Good
Knight vs The Bad Bishop" scenario. --- The first critical position arose on
move 13. Black just moved the bishop to e6. Why exactly is this not the best
positional idea?} 13. f5 {[%csl Gf5][%cal Rf5e6] A very strong continuation
that is very typical for this Najdorf structure (with the Black pawns on d6
and e5). White grabs space on the kingside and removes the pawn from f4 where
it can potentially be exchanged for the pawn on e5. When doing this maneuver,
White does need to be careful not to allow the immediate counterstrike with d5,
which is not the case here because this advance comes with the tempo on the
bishop on e6.} Bc4 $6 {[%csl Rc4] Continuing with the idea of exchanging the
bishops, but it is actually wrong as it weakens Black's grip over the d5
square. It is much easier for Black's bishop to control the d5 square than for
the bishop on e2, so this exchange is very much in White's favour.} (13... Bd7
{Retreating the bishop to d7 was objectively better, but now the e4 pawn is
not under the attack and White can once again play} 14. Bg5 Bc6 15. Bxf6 Bxf6 {
And here White has a very good grip over the d5 square that can be increased
even further by bringing the pieces to the d-file and Black is much worse than
in lines with the immediate Bd7.}) 14. Bxc4 Qxc4 15. Bg5 {[%cal Rg5e7] A very
strong move! White now exchanges the final defender of the d5 square and
intends to plant their own knight there - and there is nothing Black can do
against this plan, as Rudakovsky has just exchanged the last defender - the
bishop on e6.} Rfe8 {It is probably better to put the rook on another file as
on e8 it merely ends up in some tactical problems, but as it is, Black's
position is strategically suspect.} 16. Bxf6 Bxf6 {Now we can see Black has no
pieces that can prevent the knight from finding a happy home on d5 - and that
factor alone is already sufficient for the game to be strategically lost.} 17.
Nd5 {[%csl Ra8,Gd5,Re8][%cal Gd5c7] Furthermore - due to the positioning of
the rooks (a consequence of the move Re8) - White can jump to d5 immediately.}

{So, we have just seen how White managed to plant the knight on d5, which

{In the previous two encounters, we have seen how Smyslov had the ability to
play very violent, tactical, Tal-like chess - especially in his youth (but not
only in his youth). However, as a player, he is much more famous for his
positional, logical and "simple" style with the help of which he sometimes
outplayed his opponents imperceptibly and quietly. --- A perfect example of
"vintage" Smyslov style is the following game, played against the Ukrainian
Master Iosif Rudakovsky in the 1945 USSR Championship. It is a very famous
game that I use to this day to illustrate the power of occupying the d5 square
in the Najdorf structure and it is a classic example of the "Good Knight vs
The Bad Bishop" scenario.} 1. e4 {Once again, we see Smyslov opening with the
king's pawn.} c5 2. Nf3 {But this is a bit surprising. Already back at that
time, Smyslov started playing the Closed Sicilian variation - an opening that
would bring him a lot of success throughout his career. But, that day he
decided to go for the more principled battle in the Open Sicilian.} e6 3. d4
cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 {The pure Scheveningen variation is considered to
be a bit risky nowadays due to the possibility of advancing the g-pawn on the
next move, but of course, back in 1945 the theory of this variation (and of
many other openings) was only starting to develop.} 6. Be2 {This natural
developing move is a natural option - but not the most critical one according
to the 21st century standards.} (6. g4 $5 {This move, leading to the so-called
Keres attack, is nowadays considered to be by far the most critical test of
the Scheveningen variation.}) 6... Be7 7. O-O O-O 8. Be3 {Both sides develop
their forces in a logical and natural manner.} Nc6 {The main move in this
position, developing the knight, creating some pressure on the d4 knight and
anticipating the advance of the f-pawn that would allow Black to execute the
timely e5 counterpush in the center. Black is trying to make an argument in
this variation that moving the a-pawn is not necessary and that they can start
fighting for the center at once.} (8... a6 {Is another big move that
transposes to a version of the Scheveningen structure that can be reached via
the Najdorf move order (when Black plays a6 earlier on move 5). It was played
by a number of strong players, such as Carlsen, Anand and Ivanchuk.}) 9. f4 {
White, in turn, embarks on the standard plan for this structure, involving the
advance of the kingside pawns.} Qc7 {[%cal Gc7c6,Gc7e5] This move is somewhat
surprising, but actually not at all that bad. Black defends the knight on c6
and adds some more influence over the critical e5 square.} (9... e5 {Black
could have also considered striking in the center immediately with e5, but I
think this is a bit premature when the knight on c6 is not protected as after}
10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. fxe5 dxe5 {[%csl Rc6] Black does have inferior structure.
This is why the main moves here involve defending the c6 knight first.}) (9...
Bd7 {Defending the knight with the bishop on d7 is by far the most common and
natural move in this position.}) 10. Qe1 {[%cal Ge1g3,Gg3h4] This move,
intending to transfer the queen to the kingside, is very standard for the
Scheveningen structure, but it is not so well-timed here as it allows Black to
execute the main idea of the e5 counteradvance.} (10. a4 {[%cal Gd1d4] Keeping
the option of recapturing on d4 with the queen and making a useful
semi-waiting move for now is a better option.}) (10. Kh1 {Is also a move that
comes into consideration.}) 10... Nxd4 {[%cal Ge6e5] A typical liberating
maneuver in the Sicilian, exchanging the knight and intending to strike in the
center with e5.} 11. Bxd4 e5 12. Be3 {Now Black has equallized comfortably as
they have gained their fair share in the center.} Be6 {[%cal Gf4f5,Ge6c4] But
almost immediately, Rudakovsky makes the wrong decision, allowing the pawn to
come to f5 with a gain of tempo.} (12... Bd7 {Moving the bishop to d7 and
intending to place it on c6 was a better option as it wouldn't have allowed f5
to come with tempo. Now if} 13. f5 Bc6 {Is very strong, as after} 14. Bf3 b5 {
And White is in trouble as Black has a perfect control over the d5 square and
should bee able to execute the thematic advance of the d5 pawn very soon.}) (
12... a6 {Preparing the move b5 potentially.}) (12... b6 {Or b6 intending to
fianchetto the bishops, were both also sensible.}) (12... exf4 {Last but not
least - Black could have also executed this thematic pawn exchange, removing
the possibility of ever playing f5 from White's array of options.} 13. Bxf4 Be6
{[%csl Rd6,Re4][%cal Gf6d7,Gd7e5] In this type of structure, the weakness of
the d6 pawn is counterbalanced by the weakness of the e4 pawn and the e5
square and usually in these structures, Black should be fine if they manage to
reach a position like this one without any major concessions.}) 13. f5 {
[%csl Re6][%cal Rf5e6] A very strong continuation that is very typical for
this Najdorf structure (with the Black pawns on d6 and e5). White grabs space
on the kingside and removes the pawn from f4 where it can potentially be
exchanged for the pawn on e5. When doing this maneuver, White does need to be
careful not to allow the immediate counterstrike with d5, which is not the
case here because this advance comes with the tempo on the bishop on e6.} Bc4
$6 {Continuing with the idea of exchanging the bishops, but it is actually
wrong as it weakens Black's grip over the d5 square. It is much easier for
Black's bishop to control the d5 square than for the bishop on e2, so this
exchange is very much in White's favour.} (13... Bd7 {Retreating the bishop to
d7 was objectively better, but now the e4 pawn is not under the attack and
White can once again play} 14. Bg5 Bc6 15. Bxf6 Bxf6 {And here White has a
very good grip over the d5 square that can be increased even further by
bringing the pieces to the d-file and Black is much worse than in lines with
the immediate Bd7.}) 14. Bxc4 Qxc4 15. Bg5 {[%cal Rg5e7] A very strong move!
White now exchanges the final defender of the d5 square and intends to plant
their own knight there - and there is nothing Black can do against this plan,
as Rudakovsky has just exchanged the last defender - the bishop on e6.} Rfe8 {
It is probably better to put the rook on another file as on e8 it merely ends
up in some tactical problems, but as it is, Black's position is strategically
suspect.} 16. Bxf6 Bxf6 {Now we can see Black has no pieces that can prevent
the knight from finding a happy home on d5 - and that factor alone is already
sufficient for the game to be strategically lost.} 17. Nd5 {[%csl Ra8,Gd5,Re8]
[%cal Gd5c7] Furthermore - due to the positioning of the rooks (a consequence
of the move Re8) - White can jump to d5 immediately.} Bd8 {[%csl Gd8] A very
passive defensive move, typical of that era, that gives White everything they
ever wanted in this position.} (17... Qxc2 {For better or for worse, Black
should have probably captured the pawn on c2. At irst glance it seems as if it
loses an exchange - but at least it disrupts the natural flow of the game -
and forces White to give up the wonderful knight on d5 (that is easily worth
at least a rook). Play might continue} 18. Rf2 {[%cal Rf2a2] Attacking the
queen and defending the b2 pawn.} Qc6 {The queen has to stay on the c-file

secures the c-pawn and Black is left without any counterplay. The knight on d5
is a true octopus, influencing a large part of the board - most notably the f6
square, that creates some attacking chances.} b5 {Trying to create some play,
but this doesn't lead anywhere.} (18... f6 {Black should probably prevent
White from playing f6 once and for all and then wait to see how White will try
to break the position.}) 19. b3 (19. f6 {Was very strong already, but Smyslov

kinda futile as Black can't open any files on the queenside - but what else to
play?} 21. Rf3 {Starting to prepare the kingside attack. Due to the central

{Let's join the game slightly later - on move 25. After a few transformations,
the position has become completely winning for White, as Black has a weak pawn
on d6 and White also has the bishop pair. However, things are never very easy
in chess - currently Black wants to play Nd7, remove the bishop from b6, then
slowly unravel with Rd8, Nc5 and so on. --- Smyslov, however, found a
wonderful way to transform the advantage and transition to a favourable
endgame. Can you find the set of maneuver he played in this very moment?} 25.

White should be winning - but it is good to learn the winning technique in

{Even though there weren't any major International chess tournaments during
the World War II, in the war-torn USSR more than a few tournaments were
organized in the 1942-1945 period. Thus, Smyslov - as well as other Soviet
players - did get their regular practice and continued developing. --- It is,
therefore, not surprising that, after the war, Smyslov already turned out to
be one of the best chess players in the world. It already showed in the first
International tournament held in Groningen in 1946 where Smyslov came in third
behind Botvinnik and Euwe. Thus, it wasn't surprising that Smyslov was invited
to be one of the participants in the FIDE World Championship Tournament, held
in the Hague and Moscow in 1948. --- This tournament was supposed to resolve
the interregnum state that had arisen after Alekhine's death. Apart from
Botvinnik and Smyslov, Euwe, Keres and Reshevsky participated. It was
precisely the American grandmaster that Soviets feared the most as he was
considered to be Botvinnik's most serious competitor. --- Every encounter with
Reshevsky, was, thus, of utmost importance - but in round 11 of the tournament
Smyslov inflicted him a devastating blow. It is one of those brilliant
strategic/positional masterpieces Smyslov was rather known for and is
definitely one of his best games that fully deserves to be included on this

thing and White has a stable advantage (although a lot of chess remains to be
played, ofc).}) 13. dxe5 $1 {For me, this is an oustanding move that shows
superb judgment. White deals with the threat to the e4 pawn and claims that
Black has no good way of recapturing on e5 for positional reasons.} Bxe5 {
It is hard to say which recapture is better. Or more precisely - worse. Taking
with the bishop seems crazy as it gets rid of the bishop pair, but Black is
claiming that the knights are better in this position due to its closed nature.

{As we have previously seen, already in 1948, Smyslov was considered to be one
of the strongest players in the world and a legitimate contender for the World
Chess Championship title. And even though things didn't go his way in the very
next cycle (which was - somewhat surprisingly - won by David Bronstein) -
starting from the 1953-1954 World Championship Cycle Smyslov would dominate
the remainder of the 1950s and participate in no less than three World
Championship Matches against Mikhail Botvinnik. --- The crucial step toward
his first World Chess Championship match against Botvinnik was the legendary
Candidates Tournament 1953, played in Zürich. After 21 rounds, Smyslov was
tied with Reshevsky at 12.5/21, while the legendary Estonian Paul Keres was
just behind them with half a point less. --- It goes without saying that the
encounter between Keres and Smyslov in the 22nd round was of tremendous
competitive importance. We are now going to examine this historic game. The
first critical position arose on move 16. Smyslov didn't play the opening
perfectly and ended up in a suspicious position. How should have Keres
continued here?} 16. c5 {[%csl Gc3,Gc5][%cal Gc3c5] Advancing on the queenside

h7 pawn. Furthermore, the c-pawn now becomes an important asset in the
position.} (19... gxh5 {At first glance it is not at all clear whether the

22nd round was of tremendous competitive importance. We are now going to
examine this historic game.} 1. c4 {Keres was a very versatile player that
could open with virtually any first move. In this game, he decided to go for a
quiet, unconventional approach, avoiding the theoretical battle and trying to
maintaing the tension from the early moments, hoping to outplay Smyslov in a
later stage of the game.} Nf6 2. Nc3 e6 {Even though Smyslov was playing the
King's Indian and Grünfeld in his career, he was also regularly employing the
Nf6-e6 setups against 1.d4, so it is not that surprising to see him invite the
transposition to the Nimzo-Indian here.} 3. Nf3 {Keres still refrains from
moving the d-pawn and continues to play "around" the center.} c5 4. e3 Be7 5.
b3 {Definitely not the most ambitious way of handling the opening stage of the

theoretical battle.} O-O 6. Bb2 b6 {Black also doesn't seek immediate
confrontation and aims to develop the bishop to b7.} (6... d5 {Advancing in
the center with d5 is much more principled and was seen in a number of
high-level games - even in 2022.}) 7. d4 {Now White finally takes a moment to
push the d-pawn in the center. It is hard to count on any serious advantage
without doing so.} cxd4 8. exd4 $6 {But this is a little bit strange decision,
in my opinion. Black deliberately shuts the diagonal of the bishop on b2 and
allows Black to transpose to some sort of Colle-System position.} (8. Nxd4 {

any moment.} 9. Bd3 {Developing the bishop to a very active square and
pointing it at the Black king. Even though Black has equalized, the position
is definitely not "dead" and a lot of play remains - which is probably what
White players employing such an unpretentious scheme are hoping for.} Nc6 {
[%csl Gc6][%cal Gc6b4,Gc6e7,Gc6a5] It feels a bit strange to place the knight
to c6 where it is blocking the bishop on b7, but it is far more active there
than on d7 and can jump, say, to b4 - or even reroute itself via e7 at some
point in the future. Also, if White ever plays a3, then Na5 comes into
consideration.} 10. O-O Bb7 11. Rc1 Rc8 12. Re1 {[%cal Gf3e5] Now we have
actually transposed to one of the main lines of the Colle system that was
tested in practice many many times.Both sides bring their forces into the game.
In general, White wants to occupy the e5 square at some point.} Nb4 {[%csl Rd3]

though it was also played recently at the very high level.} (13... Re8 {
Calm move like Re8, bringing the rook to a file where it will be useful, is
very sensible, for example. White is the one who needs to find a way of
continuing next.}) 14. a3 {A nice intermediate move, kicking the knight from

dangerous for Black and it can be concluded that Keres' opening choice has
worked very well up to this point.} Nc6 16. Ne5 $2 {But almost immediately

{Thus, after winning the Zürich Candidates Tournament in 1953, Smyslov
qualified for the match against Botvinnik that was held in 1954 in Moscow.
This match turned out to be one of the most fighting and "bloodiest" in the
entire history of chess. Out of 24 games, 14 had a decisive outcome and at
some point there was a streak of 8- decisive games. --- Smyslov himself
started extremely poorly, losing 3 out of the first 4 games. However, after
winning game 7 and then scoring a hat trick in games 9-11, he took the lead
briefly before losing games 12 and 13 and finding himself trailing by a point
again. --- But then, in game 14, he managed to win again and level the scores
again. This is probably his most impressive creative achievement from that
first match and fully deserves to be mentioned here. --- Let's start our
explorations by examining the wild opening position that arose on move 14.

dubious, but it is not so easy to prove it. How would you continue as White
here? Can you find the best move?} 14. Be7 {[%cal Re7f8,Re7d6] From the modern

criticize the pioneers that trailblazed the path, but this is objectively not

the grandmaster level favour White, which is probably one of the reasons why

{[#] As we have seen previously, in the 1954 match, Smyslov failed to win the
title by the narrowest of the margins. And even though by drawing the match he
proved he is Botvinnik's equal, he had to go through the gruelling process of
qualification once again and repeat the feat of winning the Candidates
tournament - which he duly managed to do so by winning the 1956 Amsterdam
Candidates tournament - 1.5 point ahead of Keres (who once again came second).
--- Thus, in 1957, the 2nd Botvinnik - Smyslov match was held in Moscow. This
time, Smyslov was in control virtually from the start of the match. After
winning the 1st game, he did lose games 4 and 5 only to immediately level the
score in game 6 and then to seize a two point lead by winning games 8 and 12.
--- Nevertheless, Botvinnik wasn't to go away so easily as he managed to
reduce the lead by winning the 13th game. Thus, after 3 subsequent draws, by
game 17 the tension had reached the peak. It is at this particular moment that
Smyslov played the following marvellous game that virtually clinched the match
in his favour. --- In contrast to the previous game, which was a tactical
masterpiece, this game was a pure positional/strategic battle. On move 19, we
have a position with symmetricla pawn structure, but where Black arguably has
a bit more potential to improve the position. Can you find the plan/concept
Smyslov utilized to improve his position in this exact moment?} 19... a5 {

{After some further adventures, on move 45, the final critical moment of the
game arose. Here Botvinnik had one possible path toward the desired draw,

resource in this position? Note that this exercise is very difficult and that
it it far from easy to understand why exactly would this move be the best.} 45.
a4 {At this particular moment, it was absolutely necessary to advance the
a-pawn. As mentioned earlier, it would have allowed White to have a nice
defensive resource at the exact moment as the a-pawn is now closer to queening

lost for White. It is really not easy to understand why this is so relevant,

obstacle on the kingside and White also needs to lose a tempo to get the
knight back to c2 and initiate the whole idea with a4-b4 and so on - which
means that White is now objectively completely lost - in many pawn endgames,
the weakness of the e3 pawn and the potential advance of the f-pawn will be
decisive. --- I think we could stop for the purposes of this exercise as the
path toward victory is still lengthy. Still, it is very instructive to observe
how Smyslov goes about outmaneuvering Botivnnik and winning this position, so

to win this position against the computer.} 0-1

{As we have seen previously, in the 1954 match, Smyslov failed to win the
title by the narrowest of the margins. And even though by drawing the match he
proved he is Botvinnik's equal, he had to go through the gruelling process of
qualification once again and repeat the feat of winning the Candidates
tournament - which he duly managed to do so by winning the 1956 Amsterdam
Candidates tournament - 1.5 point ahead of Keres (who once again came second).
--- Thus, in 1957, the 2nd Botvinnik - Smyslov match was held in Moscow. This
time, Smyslov was in control virtually from the start of the match. After
winning the 1st game, he did lose games 4 and 5 only to immediately level the
score in game 6 and then to seize a two point lead by winning games 8 and 12.
--- Nevertheless, Botvinnik wasn't to go away so easily as he managed to
reduce the lead by winning the 13th game. Thus, after 3 subsequent draws, by
game 17 the tension had reached the peak. It is at this particular moment that
Smyslov played the following marvellous game that virtually clinched the match
in his favour.} 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. g3 g6 3. c4 c6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. d4 O-O 6. Nc3 d5 7.

it is a little bit passive, although it is still played at the grandmaster
level to this day.} 9. Bg5 {I am not 100% sure I understand this move. The
idea is potentially to eliminate the knight on f6 that can sometimes jump to
e4, but I am not sure if that is the most dangerous idea of all time.
Furthermore, the bishop is exposed to Ne4 jumps on this particular square.} (9.

the development of thee bishop and preparing to jump with the knight to e4.}
10. Bxf6 {The point of White's play. I guess the argument is that the knight
on f6 is very valuable here and that Black's dark-squared bishop doesn't have
that much scope, but still - White does give up the bishop pair voluntarily.}

whatsoever.} (11. f4 Bg7 12. h4 {This aggressive kingside expansion was seen
in a game between my two compatriots - Zdenko Kožul and Ivan Šarić - and it

ultimately ended up losing the game.}) 11... e6 12. f4 {[%csl Gd4,Ge5,Gf4] A

see in the endgame in this game).} Bg7 13. Rc1 f6 {Expelling the knight from

reroutes and also eyes the weak e4 square. Black shouldn't be worse here as
both sides have some weaknesses and weak squares, although a complex strategic
battle is in front of us.} 19. Kh2 a5 20. Rfe1 b5 {Very good play. White's
play in the center and on the kingside is somewhat stuck, while Black improves
the position on the queenside.} 21. Nd1 b4 22. Nf2 Ba6 {[%csl Ga5,Gb4][%cal

step is the occupation of the open file.} 24. Rxc8+ {This is a bit too
cooperative. As usual, exchanging on our opponent's ground helpes them more
than it helps us to relievee the tension.} (24. Rc5 {Hoping to double on the

breaking through in the center was also a bit more combative than the text
move.}) 24... Rxc8 25. Bf1 {[%csl Gb5,Gc4,Ge4] Seeking further exchanges, but

keeping the queens on the board and trying to exploit some light-squares with,
say, Nf5 next, came into consideration too.}) (26... h5 {[%csl Gf5,Gg4]
Securing some more light-squares, was also interesting.}) 27. Nd3 Qc2+ {
This looks tempting, but the queen exchange actually relinquishes a
significant part of Black's advantage.} (27... h5 {Once again, maintaining the
tension with some sort of semi-waiting move was worth considering.}) 28. Qxc2
Rxc2+ 29. Rf2 {[%csl Gf2][%cal Gd3f2] This is the problem for Black. White
manages to deal with the infiltration of the rook to c2 and now Black almost
has either exchange or retreat, meaning that a large part of the advantage is
now gone.} Rxf2+ 30. Nxf2 Nc4 31. Nd1 {[%csl Gb2][%cal Gd1e3,Gd1b2] Now all

to make progress for Black. Still, the game is far from over and now we enter
a completely new stage of the game.} Kf7 32. b3 $2 {[%csl Rc3][%cal Rb3c4] But
this is a mistake. It is natural to want to kick the knight from the c4 square,

make further progress.}) 32... Nd6 33. Kg2 h5 {[%csl Gg4] Clamping down on the

of the structure on the kingside. Smyslov probably thought White's h4 pawn
would be a weakness in the long-run, but it transpires that this is not
necessarily true.} (35... Bf8 {It was better to simply continue waiting and

diagonal is open and Black can potentially try to attack the h4 pawn (which is
what happens in the game). But it transpires that this is less strong than
what was considered in the previous note.} ({Going for the same plan of Bd6-e5

not tied to the defence of the g-pawn, so after} 36... Bf8 37. Ne1 Bd6 38. Nd3

sharply alter the character of play and go for the transformation of the
position.} Nc3 $5 {Sharply changing the character of play at the verge of the
first time control (which usually happened on move 40). Smyslov invites the

seemingly there is no way for Botvinnik to refuse it!} ({If Black continues
waiting, White has several ways of maintaining the balance.} 39... Be7 40. N1b2

moment and ask ourselves - why exactly should Black pretend to be better in
this endgame? Well, the pawn on c3 is a temporary distraction for our opponent
and needs to be dealt with. The only way in which White can do so is going
with the king all the way to d3 and then capturing it. This, in turn should
allow Black to capture the h4 pawn (which is something h can do anyway,
actually) and run with king to f2, threatening to capture on e3. Furthermore,
Black can also push g5 and then f4 at the appropriate moment. Thus, White has
to defend accurately as Black has a clear plan of going forward.} 41. Ne1 {

after 22 games with the score 12.5-9.5, becoming, thus, the 7th World Champion.

{[#] Thus, after losing the World Championship title in 1958 to Botvinnik,
Smyslov didn't get another opportunity to fight for the World Chess
Championship title until his shocking swansong in the 1983 cycle when he
reached the final of the Candidates cycle before losing to the future World
Champion, Garry Kasparov. --- As this feat suggest, despite being the World
Champion only for a single year, Smyslov continued playing at the high level
and very succesfully throughout his life. Due to his very logical and harmonic
style and arguably his deep love for the game, he wasn't as affected by the
age factor (or by health issues, like, for example, Tal) like some other
players and continued to play tournaments all the way until the end of 1990s.

over a 30+ year long period, but I feel like any collection of Smyslov's best
games should include the following fascinating game, played at the 6th Soviet
Team Cup held in Riga in 1968. --- Let's start our journey through it by

{Thus, after losing the World Championship title in 1958 to Botvinnik, Smyslov
didn't get another opportunity to fight for the World Chess Championship title
until his shocking swansong in the 1983 cycle when he reached the final of the
Candidates cycle before losing to the future World Champion, Garry Kasparov.
--- As this feat suggest, despite being the World Champion only for a single
year, Smyslov continued playing at the high level and very succesfully
throughout his life. Due to his very logical and harmonic style and arguably
his deep love for the game, he wasn't as affected by the age factor (or by
health issues, like, for example, Tal) like some other players and continued
to play tournaments all the way until the end of 1990s. --- Of course, it is
very hard to make a selection of the best games played over a 30+ year long
period, but I feel like any collection of Smyslov's best games should include
the following fascinating game, played at the 6th Soviet Team Cup held in Riga
in 1968.} 1. c4 {Not a surprising opening move by Smyslov. Especially in his
later years, he switched from 1.e4 to slower, closed systems with increasing
frequency.} e5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. Rb1 {Preparing the push of
the b-pawn is a standard plan in a number of positions where the pawn on c4 is
meeting the pawn on e5.} d6 6. b4 a6 {I am not sure if this move is required
as it helps White to open up things on the queenside with b5, although it was
played by some strong players so what do I even know.} 7. e3 f5 {I am also not
too sure about this aggressive setup with f5 in these positions - especially
with White having played e3 instead of d3, but once again, since I don't play
these positions with either colour my insight should be taken with a huge
grain of salt. --- Nevertheless, this is a very fresh position with only a
handful of games in the database.} 8. Nge2 Nf6 9. d3 O-O 10. O-O Bd7 11. a4 {
[%cal Gb4b5] White is very clearly preparing to go b5.} Rb8 {But this move
doesn't make sense to me at all. If you played a6 earlier, weren't you hoping
to open up the a-file for the rook once b5 happens? Why defend the pawn
modestly with the rook then and deviate from that plan?} (11... Qe7 {A normal
developing move seemed quite sensible. After} 12. b5 axb5 13. axb5 Nd8 {
Black defends b7 and has the a-file open, which is certainly better than what
happened in the game.}) 12. b5 axb5 13. axb5 Ne7 14. Ba3 {[%cal Ra3f8,Gb5b6]
An active place for the bishop in these positions, as it is fairly active on
this diagonal and eyeing the c5 square, preparing for the potential c5 push.
There is also the idea of playing b6 next.} Be6 15. Qb3 {I am not 100% sure
about this move as now c5 is not possible, although the computer doesn't
complain.} (15. c5 {Would be my expectation, although after} d5 16. c6 {
The situation is not completely clear.}) (15. Qc2 {I would also expect moving
the queen to a square where there is no pin would be more sensible but, then
again - what do I know. The engine thinks all these moves are roughly
equivalent.}) 15... b6 $6 {But this is apparently wrong. Black decides to
prevent c5 once at for all, but he is playing on the side of the board where
their opponent is attacking.} (15... Qd7 {A semi-waiting move like this one
was quite reasonable. Then after, say} 16. f4 Bf7 17. b6 c6 {The situation is
complicated, but Black is by no means THAT much worse.}) (15... Bf7 {It was
also possible to play this prophylactic move, intending now to meet} 16. f4 {
With} exf4 17. Nxf4 {When the bishop is not under the attack.}) 16. d4 {
Quite a good move, trying to react in the center. White also tries to exploit
the newly weakened c6 square? How exactly. Watch and see!} e4 {Black can't
afford the center to open given that all White pieces are very actively placed.
} 17. d5 {[%csl Gc6,Gd4,Re6][%cal Rd5e6,Ge2d4,Gd4c6,Ga3b2] A very nice
positional move, opening up the d4 square for the knight from where it can go
to e6 and c6. It is true that this move weakens the e5 and c5 squares, but we
have to lose some to gain some. Also, with this move we pretty much give up on
the c5 idea, but we are ready to reroute our bishop to b2.} Bf7 18. Nd4 Qd7 (

consideration.})) 19. Bb2 {[%cal Rb2g7] The bishop retreats to the long
diagonal.} g5 {Trying to initiate some kingside play and gain some space on

Smyslov doesn't hurry to jump with the d4 knight to either e6 or c6.} (20. Nc6

might be in danger on this square in the future.} ({A move such as} 20... Bh5 {
was probably better, trying to activate some pieces and potentially echange
this slumbering bishop for the knight on e2.}) 21. Ra1 Ng6 22. f4 {A very
powerful move, opening up the kingside to White's advantage and at the same
time preventing Balck from ever playing f4! White's pieces are all perfectly
placed so it is very natural that a pawn move is the best.} exf3 {[%csl Re3,
Ge4,Gg4] Now, it is true that White has weakened the e3 square and provided
the e4 and g4 squares into Black's hands, but in this position where both
sides have some weak squares, Black's weaknesses are more pronounced simply
because White has better placed pieces.} 23. Rxf3 $6 {This is, actually, not
the most precise continuation.} (23. Nxf3 {[%csl Rg5][%cal Rf3g5,Rb2h8] Taking
with the knight, opening up the bishop and threatening the g5 pawn was
actually better. After, say} h6 (23... Ne4 24. Bxg7+ Kxg7 25. Nfd4 {[%cal

in both lines, but it is much more combative and murky than the game

a weak square and hoping to eliminate the important defender of the f5 pawn.

{[#] As mentioned earlier, despite being an ex-world champion already in 1958,
Smyslov continued to compete at the high level for decades. Arguably the
greatest achievement from his later years happened in the 1982-1985 cycle. ---
First, Smsylov qualified for the Candidates matches by winning the 2nd place
at the strong Interzonal in Las Palmas (at the time, 3 Interzonals were held
and two players from each Interzonal were seeded in the Candidates matches,
together with the finalists from the previous cycle). --- Then, in the
quarterfinal Candidates match, luck shined on him as he managed to eliminate
Robert Hübner (the regular match ended up 5-5, four tiebreak games also
didn't produce a winner which was, in the end, decided by a spin of the
roulette wheel!!). --- Then, in the semi-final Candidate match, Smyslov faced
the strong Hungarian grandmaster Zoltan Ribli. After the wins were exchanged
in the first two games and two subsequent games, the score in the match was
tied. Then, the fifth game happened where Smyslov produced the following
masterpiece. --- We join the action on move 16. Up to this moment, Ribli has
been outplaying Smyslov quite convincingly in the position with an isolated
queen pawn and obtained a very good, almost winning position. However, at this
crtiical moment, he underestimated the danger and made a big mistake. Can you
improve on his play and find a reasonable move for Black in this position?} 
16... Nf5 {[%csl Gf5][%cal Rf5d4,Rd3h7] It was far better to move the knight
to f5 and prevent the queen from going to h7 so easily. If White wants to
insist on it, he has to go for} (16... Ng6 {Is also better than what Ribli did
in the game, although the knight is more active on f5, for sure.}) (16... Ba4

the potential danger to his king and allows Smyslov to grab the initiative.})
17. g4 Nd6 {[%cal Gg8f8,Gf8e7] When now the knight is on d6 and not on e7 -
which means that the king has the e7 square available after, say} 18. Qh7+ Kf8

is now on g4, makes a whole lot of difference in the position. White doesn't
have an attack here and Black should be objectively winning (although the
position does remain to be difficult to play for both sides).} 1-0

{As mentioned earlier, despite being an ex-world champion already in 1958,
Smyslov continued to compete at the high level for decades. Arguably the
greatest achievement from his later years happened in the 1982-1985 cycle. ---
First, Smsylov qualified for the Candidates matches by winning the 2nd place
at the strong Interzonal in Las Palmas (at the time, 3 Interzonals were held
and two players from each Interzonal were seeded in the Candidates matches,
together with the finalists from the previous cycle). --- Then, in the
quarterfinal Candidates match, luck shined on him as he managed to eliminate
Robert Hübner (the regular match ended up 5-5, four tiebreak games also
didn't produce a winner which was, in the end, decided by a spin of the
roulette wheel!!). --- Then, in the semi-final Candidate match, Smyslov faced
the strong Hungarian grandmaster Zoltan Ribli. After the wins were exchanged
in the first two games and two subsequent games, the score in the match was
tied. Then, the fifth game happened where Smyslov produced the following
masterpiece.} 1. d4 {No more 1.e4 stuff that were prominent in Smyslov's youth.
Note that he was 62 years old at the time when this match was played!} Nf6 2.
Nf3 e6 3. c4 d5 4. Nc3 c5 {The Tarrasch defence was all the rage in those days
(remember that Kasparov used it in the very same cycle with great effect).
Nowadays, this move-order is seen quite frequently as well, but mainly because
Black immediately opts to go for the very provocative variation involving the
immediate recapture on d4.} 5. cxd5 Nxd5 {With this move order, Black opts to
go for the very-solid Semi-Tarrasch variation!} (5... exd5 {Would lead to the
pure Tarrasch variation where Black accepts the isolated pawn but claims that
the dynamic chances compensate for this strategic weakness. Nowadays this
variation is not seen that often at the very top level, although it is a
frequent guest at the club level.}) (5... cxd4 {At the very top level, this
forcing line is nowadays all the rage. After} 6. Qxd4 exd5 7. e4 {It was
discovered that the endgame arising after} dxe4 8. Qxd8+ Kxd8 9. Ng5 Be6 10.
Nxe6+ fxe6 {Is not at all so advantageous for White as it looks at the first
glance (better structure, pair of bishops).}) 6. e3 {Not the most ambitious
test of Black's opening scheme.} (6. e4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 cxd4 8. cxd4 {Is another
big theoretical line these days.}) 6... Nc6 7. Bd3 Be7 8. O-O O-O 9. a3 cxd4
10. exd4 {So, by transposition we have reached a standard position where White
is the one with the isolated pawn on d4. Still, White has numerous attacking
ideas here so the weakness of the isolated pawn shouldn't be overemphasized.}
Bf6 {[%cal Rf6d4] Placing the bishop on a square where it is exerting pressure
on the d4 pawn and controlling the e5 square is quite logical - although not
the only way of handling the position.} 11. Qc2 {[%cal Rc2h7] With this move,
White tries to provoke a concession on the kingside as now the knight is
unable to go to f6 to defend the h7 pawn. Once again, there are other natural
moves in the position, but this idea seems quite reasonable.} h6 {Trying to go
without the weakening of the dark-squares, but this move allows White to try
to go for the more standard battery with the queen in front of the bishop (as
we will see happen in the game).} (11... g6 {Would weaken the dark-squares and
after} 12. Bh6 Bg7 13. Bxg7 Kxg7 {White can make an argument that the weakened
dark-squares make the Black king a little bit less secure!}) 12. Rd1 {Also
bringing the rook into play and indirectly defending the d4 pawn.} Qb6 {
[%csl Gc8][%cal Rb6d4,Rc6d4,Rf6d4] But this move is a bit too optimistic. The
queen tries to pressure the d4 pawn, but it is not particularly well-placed on
b6 and it is blocking the standard b6-Bb7 development.} (12... Re8 {Or
something similar, was more natural in this position.}) (12... Bd7 {Developing
the bishop at once and intending to maybe place it on c6, was also quite
natural.}) 13. Bc4 $6 {But this is not the most precise move. Smyslov tries to
pressure the d5 point and potentially exchange there and eliminate the
weakness, but it transpires Black has ways of dealing with that idea.} (13.
Bh7+ Kh8 14. Be4 {Was stronger. The idea is to keep the bishop on a more
active diagonal and also to displace the king. Now if} Nce7 15. h4 {[%cal
Gg2g4,Gg4g5] And suddenly g4-g5 is coming with a very great effect. Typical
computer stuff.} Bd7 16. g4 {[%cal Gg4g5] Here there is no good way to defend
against the unpleasant g5 somehow and White is doing very well.}) 13... Rd8 {
[%csl Gd5][%cal Gd8d5] Reinforcing the d5 point and intending to take on c3
next.} (13... Nce7 {Trying to reinforce the d5 point is also possible as now}
14. h4 Bd7 15. g4 {Isn't dangerous at all with the bishop exposed on c4 e.g.}
Nxc3 16. bxc3 Qc7 17. Bd3 Bc6 {And the few tempi that Black has gained make
all the difference in the world.}) (13... Nxc3 {Is a bit premature as after}
14. bxc3 Ne7 15. Bf4 Bd7 16. Ne5 {The bishop on d7 is not defended by the rook
which gives White one tempo. Not the most important tempo in the world, but it
makes a difference to a certain extent.}) 14. Ne2 {Trying to avoid the
exchange of the knight on c3, but it is clear this retreat is not the most
desirable move in this type of position.} ({In order to illustrate the point,
let's see what happens if White plays some natural move such as} 14. h3 Nxc3 {
Now this thematic exchange, going for the position with hanging pawns, makes a
lot of sense, as after} 15. bxc3 Ne7 16. Bf4 Bd7 17. Ne5 {The bishop on d7 is
defended and Black can continue harmoniously with} Rac8 {This might not look
like such a big deal, but now the bishop on c7 is under threat and Black has a
very harmonious position. In both cases the chances are approximately balanced,
but this small nuances are important for human players.}) 14... Bd7 15. Qe4 {
Smyslov intends to put the bishop on d3 and create some threats to the king,
although objectively speaking this shouldn't work - especially since White
lost some time moving the queen and the bishop back and forth.} Nce7 16. Bd3 {
[%cal Gd3h7] Threatening to infiltrate with the queen on h7.} Ba4 $2 {So far,
Ribli has been playing an excellent game, but here he misjudges the potential
danger to his king and allows Smyslov to grab the initiative.} (16... Nf5 {
[%csl Gf5][%cal Rf5d4,Rd3h7] It was far better to move the knight to f5 and
prevent the queen from going to h7 so easily. If White wants to insist on it,
he has to go for} 17. g4 Nd6 {When now the knight is on d6 and not on e7 -
which means that the king has the e7 square available after, say} 18. Qh7+ Kf8
19. Ng3 Ke7 {This, in combination with the fact that the pawn is now on g4,
makes a whole lot of difference in the position. White doesn't have an attack
here and Black should be objectively winning (although the position does
remain to be difficult to play for both sides).}) 17. Qh7+ Kf8 18. Re1 Bb5 {
[%cal Rb5e2] Trying to exchange the light-squared bishop is quite sensible as
it gets rid of an important attacking piece.} (18... Rac8 {Ignoring the danger
and continuing the play is now too risky as after} 19. Ng3 {Nh5 is now a very
serious threat, e.g.} Bxd4 20. Nh5 Ng8 {And here White has the amazing} 21. Re5
{When g7 will fall and when Black's monarch is in real danger. This is, of
course, a cooperative variation, but one that illustrates the potential
dangers to the Black king.}) 19. Bxb5 (19. Be4 {Trying to keep the bishop is
sensible, but it allows} Bxe2 {This knight is also an important attacker and
with it gone, White's attack is gone as well. Thus Smyslov correctly keeps
this knight and allows the exchange of the bishop.}) 19... Qxb5 20. Ng3 {
[%cal Gg3h5,Gf3e5] One knight is heading to h5 and the other to e5. Black
should still have defensive resources here, but it is not too easy to handle
this in a practical game.} (20. a4 {[%cal Ga1a3,Ga3h3] With the idea of
including the rook into the attack, was also quite interesting.}) 20... Ng6 {
[%cal Gg6h8] Black takes a moment to open up the e7 square for the king and to
cover the annoying check on h8, although it is debatable whether this was yet
necessary. Still, sooner or later this knight will go to g6, so there is not
that much harm in doing it at this point.} 21. Ne5 {[%cal Re5g6] Bringing the
knight into the attack is very sensible.} (21. b3 {IS also a very interesting
move here. The idea is to play a4-Ba3 next. Say after} Rac8 22. a4 Qxb3 23. Nh5
{White also has some options of Ba3 at the right moment and the position looks
quite dangerous for Black. The engine suggests the best way is to give up the
exchange with} Rxc1 {Eliminating the strong dark-squared bishop.} 24. Rexc1 Qd3
{[%cal Gd3f5] And White has an extra exchange, but Black is very solid and
White's queen is somewhat stuck on h7, so the position is relatively unclear 
(although if anyone should have the upper hand it is White).}) 21... Nde7 $4 {
At the critical moment, Ribli goes full passive mode and underestimated the
dynamic possibilities available at White in this position.} ({First of all,
let us establish that captures on e5 don't work. Taking with the bishop is bad
as after} 21... Bxe5 22. dxe5 {[%cal Gg3h5] Nh5 comes and Black can't defend
g7.}) (21... Nxe5 {Is no better as after} 22. dxe5 {The bishop doesn't have a
good square.} Bg5 (22... Bh4 23. Bxh6) (22... Be7 23. Qh8#) 23. Bxg5 hxg5 24.
Ne4 {And White has a winning position here as Black's kingside is collapsing.})
(21... Qa5 {[%csl Re1][%cal Ra5e1] It transpires that attacking the rook,
bringing the queen to c7 and completely ignoring the knight on e5 (and the
threat on g6) was the best (and virtually the only) defence. After} 22. b4 Qc7
23. Nxg6+ (23. Be3 {Might be better, but once again, it is unclear how much of
advantage White has in this position.}) 23... fxg6 24. Qxg6 Bxd4 {Black's
point is that provoking b4 has allowed them to gain a tempo and that their
position is perfectly fine in this instance. This would have definitely been
better than the text move, although such a defensive move is extremely
difficult to find (unless you are an engine).}) 22. Bxh6 $3 {Boom. Now Black's
position collapses at once!} Nxe5 (22... gxh6 23. Qxf7#) (22... Bxe5 23. Rxe5
Nxe5 24. Qxg7+ {is not an improvement for Black.}) 23. Nh5 {[%cal Rh5g7,Rh6g7,
Rh7g7] The pressure against the g7 point is at its peak!} (23. dxe5 {Is also
good enough, as after} Bxe5 24. Nh5 Nf5 25. Bg5 {Black has to give up some
material or get mated!} f6 26. g4 $18) 23... Nf3+ {A possible defence, trying
to eliminate the option of advancing the g-pawn, but it doesn't change much.} (
23... Nf5 24. dxe5 Bxe5 25. Bg5 {Transposes to the line analyzed earlier.}) 24.
gxf3 Nf5 25. Nxf6 Nxh6 26. d5 {[%cal Re1e8] A wonderful move, creating
pressure against the e6 pawn and also creating various tactical ideas
associated with the capture on e6 and with the d6 discoveries.} (26. Qh8+ $4 {
Would be horrible as after} Ke7 27. Qxg7 {And suddenly White is the one losing
after} Rg8 28. Nxg8+ Rxg8 {[%cal Rg8g1] it is never too late to lose a game of
chess, I guess!}) 26... Qxb2 {[%cal Rb2f6] This loses by force - but what else
should Black play? Black at least tries to disturb the knight on f6, but now
Smyslov finds a very nice combination.} (26... Rac8 27. Qh8+ Ke7 28. Qxg7 {
is now winning for White as after} Rg8 29. Rxe6+ {Wins on the spot. This was
the point behind including the d5 move in the mix!}) (26... Ke7 {loses in a
very similar fashion:} 27. Qxg7 Rg8 28. Rxe6+) 27. Qh8+ Ke7 28. Rxe6+ $3 {
[%cal Re6e7,Rh8g7] A tremendous blow, opening up the 7th rank with a decisive
effect.} fxe6 29. Qxg7+ {[%csl Rb2][%cal Rg7b2] Now you can see some
discoveries are lining up against the queen on b2.} Nf7 {What else?} (29... Kd6
30. Ne4+ {Loses the queen on the spot.}) 30. d6+ {[%cal Gf6d5,Rd6e7] The crux
of the combination. White frees the d5 square for the knight in order to
deliver the fatal discovered attack on the queen on b2!} ({Only not} 30. Ng8+

Qxb2 {Black has a rook and the knight for the queen and a pawn, which is
insufficient material compensation. Furthermore, the king is weak and the

in converting this position into a full point!} b6 33. Qb4+ Kf6 34. Re1 Rh8 35.

towel. A wonderful creative achievement, sort of a swanson of Smyslov's career
- even if the opening was very suspect from the modern day standards. After
this game, Smyslov took 1-point lead and then went on to win game 7, as well
as the match, qualifying for the final Candidates match against Garry Kasparov.

chess - perhaps only Viktor Korchnoi achieved the same success in the World

Candidates Final match above the age of 60).} 1-0

way past their peak. Still, it is a fascinating encounter.} Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3.

treated this positions, say in the game Aronian - Svidler, World Championship

future opening of the b-file} (16. Nd5 O-O 17. Rhf1 Bc6 18. a4 {It also made
sense to keep the rook on the a-file and try for the a4-a5 push.} Nd4 {And
White retains some advantage} (18... a5 {To my human mind, this move would be
logical. However, after} 19. b5 Bb7 20. Rf2 {[pgndiagram] The queenside is
blocked, and White can start operating on the kingside. Black has less space,
so it is harder for him to move his pieces to the aid of his king})) 16... Bc6
17. Rhf1 Bb7 $6 18. Kg1 Nc6 $6 {Once again delaying castling. The move seems
sensible, exploiting the d4 square. But as it will turn out, The knight on e5
was a good piece and the knight on d4 will be doing nothing} (18... O-O 19. Nd5

Black is very much in the game}) 19. Nd5 Ncd4 20. Bd1 {[pgndiagram] Now Black
has some issues. The problem is he can't take on d5, as his knight on e6 will
get hit, and it doesn't have a good square. Compare this to a previous
variation where the knight from e6 jumped to d4.} f6 $2 {But this is a fatal
weakening. In the future, g5 will be deadly.} (20... O-O {For better or for
worse, Black should have castled} 21. bxc5 dxc5 22. g5 {And White is clearly
better, but the game is far from over}) 21. Kh2 $2 {This time, Botvinnik plays
too cautiously} (21. g5 {Was deadly here. After} Nxg5 22. Bxg5 fxg5 23. bxc5

plan consistently} (22. g5 {Was once again possible, although without Qh2, it
is not as deadly} Nxg5 23. Bxg5 fxg5 24. Bg4 {And due to his king being
uncastled, Black has issues}) 22... a5 $6 {But this only helps White - the
b-file is added to his arsenal} (22... O-O {Was the alternative} 23. Qf2 g5 {
And the position is ugly, but defensible}) 23. bxa5 bxa5 24. Qf2 (24. g5 $1)
24... Ra7 $2 {A mistake, but the position was very difficult} (24... O-O {Is
suggested by the engine as the best move, but it is understandable that Black
didn't want to lose a pawn when he had just avoided castling for a number of
moves}) 25. g5 $1 {[pgndiagram] Finally, Botvinnik carries out this strong
advance} O-O $5 {The best defensive try} (25... Nxg5 26. Bxg5 fxg5 27. Bh5+
Rxh5 28. Qf8+ {[pgndiagram] Is winning for White}) 26. g6 {White is
threatening Qxh4 and Black has to do something} f5 $2 {A final mistake - a
tactical oversight} (26... Be8 {Focusing on the g-pawn was the only defence.
White's best continuation is to defend it with his queen} 27. Qg2 $1 {
[pgndiagram] Very important but not the easiest move to find. And then he
threatens Qg4-Qh5-Qh7. Then after} (27. Rg1 f5 {And Black has avoided the worst
}) 27... f5 28. exf5 Rxf5 29. Rxf5 Nxf5 30. Qg4 Nfd4 31. Bxd4 Nxd4 32. Qh5 {
Black will be forced to sacrifice a piece, but at least he could have hoped
White won't find the accurate 27th move}) 27. Rb8 {[pgndiagram] A brilliant
concluding stroke on the theme of diversion. Once the queen takes the rook (or
moves anywhere, for that matter), White takes on h4 and checkmates. In my
opinion a brilliant game, displaying Botvinnik's best characteristics -
consistent implementation of a strategical plan followed up by a decisive
tactical combo.} 1-0

{Even though there weren't any major International chess tournaments during
the World War II, in the war-torn USSR more than a few tournaments were
organized in the 1942-1945 period. Thus, Smyslov - as well as other Soviet
players - did get their regular practice and continued developing. --- It is,
therefore, not surprising that, after the war, Smyslov already turned out to
be one of the best chess players in the world. It already showed in the first
International tournament held in Groningen in 1946 where Smyslov came in third
behind Botvinnik and Euwe. Thus, it wasn't surprising that Smyslov was invited
to be one of the participants in the FIDE World Championship Tournament, held
in the Hague and Moscow in 1948. --- This tournament was supposed to resolve
the interregnum state that had arisen after Alekhine's death. Apart from
Botvinnik and Smyslov, Euwe, Keres and Reshevsky participated. It was
precisely the American grandmaster that Soviets feared the most as he was
considered to be Botvinnik's most serious competitor. --- Every encounter with
Reshevsky, was, thus, of utmost importance - but in round 11 of the tournament
Smyslov inflicted him a devastating blow. It is one of those brilliant
strategic/positional masterpieces Smyslov was rather known for and is
definitely one of his best games that fully deserves to be included on this
list. --- Let's join the game at the first critical moment - on move 13.
Reshevsky used the Steinitz Defence of the Ruy Lopez in this game, but didn't
handle the opening in very critical manner (not surprising, given that
Reshevsky was never a true opening specialist). Yet, in the diagram position,
there is a lot of tension in the center and it is not so easy to figure out
how best to handle it. How would you continue as White here? Can you find the
move Smyslov played?} 13. dxe5 $1 {For me, this is an oustanding move that
shows superb judgment. White deals with the threat to the e4 pawn and claims
that Black has no good way of recapturing on e5 for positional reasons.} Bxe5 {
It is hard to say which recapture is better. Or more precisely - worse. Taking
with the bishop seems crazy as it gets rid of the bishop pair, but Black is
claiming that the knights are better in this position due to its closed nature.
} (13... Ngxe5 {Taking with the knight would be met with} 14. Nxe5 {A very
strong idea, once again emphasizing the fact that Black doesn't have good way
of recapturing.} (14. Nd2 {[%cal Gf2f4] Even this knight retreat, preserving
the pieces and preparing f4, is possible.}) 14... Nxe5 (14... dxe5 {Always
loses to} 15. Nxf6+ {[%cal Rd1d7] When Black is unable to recapture on f6 with

duo in the center and Black is suffering from the lack of space.}) (13... Ncxe5
14. Nxe5 {Leads to a very similar variations as after 13...Ngxe5.}) (13... dxe5
{Taking with the pawn is losing on the spot as after} 14. Nxf6+ {[%cal Rd1d7]

place a piece on e5 so that f4 can happen next.} dxe5 {[%csl Ge5][%cal Ge5f4]
Black is trying to stabillize the center and prevent the whole f4 idea, but
this invites different kinds of problems.} (14... Ngxe5 15. f4 {Is still very
dangerous for Black.}) (14... Ncxe5 15. f4 {Leads to something very similar.})

attractive.}) 15. Qf3 {[%cal Rf3f7,Rb3f7] Threatening all sorts of discoveries
against f7. Black's problem are passive pieces - the knight is unable to jump
to f4 and the other one is severely restricted by the c3 pawn.} 1-0
